			<h4>Conflict</h4>
			<p>I have to say my first thought when talking about conflict is screenwriting. Which for anyone who hasn't gone to film school may seem odd but I remember distinctly my first screenwriting class and how the concept of conflict was presented as the driver of all stories. While there is considerable truth to this, I remember how much it bothered me at the time because conflict itself was never an interest of mine. I was never inspired to write stories based on conflict, but at the same time there was admittedly always a conflict in my stories that occurred naturally out of the characters' motivations and actions.</p>
		
			<h4>Personally Speaking</h4>
			<p>In my own life there was one big conflict that occurred to me recently. Similar to my feelings about writing stories it wasn't my intention to get into a conflict, but my motivations and my basic identity and ideals are what caused it to occur.</p>
			<p>I had risen fairly high up in my last job. I was the director of a department and working at times directly under the owners of the company. The place had been even according to them a mess which "they had never been able to get right" and I was brought on as it was explained to me to bring the experience needed to make it work. The experience to do this was something I had, and for awhile it was quite a great experience to have my own department, hire whomever I wanted and run it how I saw fit. They were great times and I will remember them for some time to come. </p>
			<p>But I had a fundamental presupposition. In my mind a company existed for two aims. To benefit its customers first of all, and secondly to benefit its employees. Any company incapable of that in my mind did not deserve to exist. So therein lied the conflict that I found myself a part of.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>Cash Money</h4>
			<p>The owners of the company fundamentally did not see it that way. Massive turnover of employees, disposable customers and complete lack of diversity did not even enter their radar. Profits, and the bottom line, were their sole preoccupation and the real reason for the company and their involvement. As simple as it sounds, and fundamentally in the end really was, I had a very difficult time understanding it and dealing with it in my time there.</p>
			<p>There were times when I withdrew. Vowing to quit but never going through with finding another better place to work.</p>
			<p>There were times when I avoided the looming inevitability, throwing parties with my department to celebrate the small accomplishments I was able to achieve.</p>
			<p>And there were times when I stood my ground, steadfastly accusing them of ignoring my ideas and accusing theirs of being the stupidest suggestions I'd ever heard. Towards the end especially, I became very fed up with their way of conducting themselves, speaking very loudly about how idiotic and selfish I felt their actions were.</p>

			<h4>Moving On</h4>
			<p>So they outsourced my department. That's what happened in the end. They saved $15 a wedding by chopping up my domain and dividing it amongst four different companies in India. They got rid of me, the thorn in their side, and replaced me with obedient servants across the world who wouldn't dare question them for fear of losing their business.</p>
			<p>I have no doubt they are happy with their decision. They are personally richer and they are that much closer to the biggest payoff, the selling off of their company (before its ultimate self-destruction). I think the hardest thing for me in this conflict was to realize that my opponents were not idiots. I felt they were because they were missing in my mind the whole point of life, but in the end they knew what they were doing. They knew a business with this many issues, the turnover and the thousands of unsatisfied customers could never last. So the only answer for them was to sell it off before everything hit the fan. They weren't stupid, they just fundamentally disagreed with my values.</p>
			<p>Which frankly in the long run I still think makes them fools, because they are missing out on the most important things in life. But ultimately the solution for me is not to fight them to the death. My time and my life is too valuable, and I am moving on to new and larger ventures.</p>
			<p>In the end this conflict ended with my being laid off. That is not to say I wasn't already looking for new places to work, because I was, but it was definitely their action not mine that drew it to a close. In the end I am grateful to be out of there, and fundamentally much better off because of it. What could I have done differently? I do wish I'd been able to do more in my time there to make it a better company. But at the same time I know I have bigger things ahead of me then fighting my bosses over how many weddings we should be ruining per customer. I've moved on, and ultimately that was the best move I could make. </p>

		<h3 class="art_title">Know Thyself</a></h3>
		<img src="images/Gnothi_seauton.jpg" width="450px">
		<div>
			<h4>Exploring my Values</h4>
			<p>I chose self-knowledge from the list of values as the most important for me because as I was going down the list and seeing the values that resonated with me, what ultimately tied them all together and has genuinely led to the times in my life when I've been the most happy/satisfied has been knowing myself enough to make the right decisions, to pursue the things that would make me happy and hold on to the things that mattered. When I saw self-knowledge on the list, it reminded me of the old maxim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself" target="_blank">know thyself</a>, which has always resonated with me and helped me find my way in life when I was lost.</p>
			<p>It's definitely one of the more cheesy things anyone can say, and as such I think it has lost a lot of its meaning, but the phrase follow your heart I think is similar in a lot of ways. Whatever makes you most happy or feel most fulfilled in life, to know what those things are in the first place and secondly to know how to follow them begins as I see it with knowing yourself. It's a lifelong process of discovery, or at least it has been for me, but with each step I feel like I get closer not just to being in harmony with myself, but also with the world around me at the same time, as the two come together in a sense hand in hand.</p>

			<h4>This above All: To Thine Own Self be True</h4>
			<p>I think life in general is always up and down. We make mistakes but we learn from them, and we grow as such. As someone who's suffered from depression, growing up I never really expected to live very long, which it turns out is a symptom of depression. But I can actually say that in a very real sense my life has gotten better over time, and the one tangible thing I can see that has changed with time is my knowledge of myself. It comes back in a way to mindfulness and some of the material we talked about earlier when we started Phase 0.</p>
			<p>Finding your place in the world isn't easy and never will be I'm sure. But it's a journey we're all on together and one that our experiences at DBC are a part of. Something in our lives has led us all here to wanting to become developers. Knowing what that is I think is as important as knowing how to get there. I look forward to exploring both more in depth as we go, and continuing the life journey that brought me here, and wherever I'll end up next.</p>

		<h3 class="art_title">Stereotypes</h3>
		<img src="images/stereotype_woman.jpg">
		<div>
			<h4>My Experience</h4>
			<p>Dealing with the negative consequences of stereotypes and stereotype threat has not been a big part of my life for me personally. As a white male, the closest I've come to ever experiencing any racism or prejudice directly, besides hearing stories from non-white friends, has been a handful of mostly indirect experiences.</p>

			<h4>Worker Clones</h4>
			<p>The biggest example I can think of is from my last job. I was one of several different department directors who were in charge of hiring for the company and although I didn't realize it at first, there was a distinct difference in my approach, and therefore my department, when it came to my hiring style.</p>
			<p>Where I worked there was not a shortage of women, in fact the company was probably over 50% women although it was started and owned by three men. It was in the wedding industry, so maybe that's a stereotype in and off itself that the company was mostly women, but that is just how it always was when I was there. Racially though it was pretty white. There were less then a handful of non-white employees when I started, and for the most part outside of my department that number didn't really change.</p>
			<p>I'm not sure when I first realized it, it was after a while of being there, but it distinctly occured to me one day how different my hiring style was then the other directors. Each of them seemed to be following the same pattern within their respective departments, hiring only new employees who as closely as possible resembled themselves. Not just physically, but personality-wise, in every way possible. They all seemed to have created little pods of clones of themselves, people who listened to the same music, talked about the same things, etc. It must have been like looking in the mirror for them all day. I apparently never got this memo.</p>
			<p>Personally the whole idea of being surrounded by people just like me all day seems totally depressing. Why anyone would want that I do not understand. My hiring style was only ever interviewing the top candidates and choosing the best for the job to join our team. That didn't bring in all minorities naturally, but it certainly brought in a mix basically equivalent to the diversity that applied. Which pretty quickly began to stand out.</p>
			<p>The company even produced a video of itself and in showing off its employees came specifically to my department to film several of my people for the explicit purpose of making them look more diverse. They wanted to the outside world to appear like they weren't all the same, but at the same time they all wanted to be the same.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>Self-Handicapping</h4>
			<p>Although I haven't personally encountered a lot of stereotype threat, the concept of subconscious self-handicapping is one I feel I've seen too often in others and at times in myself.</p>
			<p>Like everyone I've definitely developed my own fears, both conscious and subconsious, throughout the course of my life. I would say it's almost impossible not to without living in a pretty intense bubble separated from the real world. Talking about our fears, and making them conscious whether through self-reflection or however you find a way, is the first step I think to recovery from the negative effects they can have on us. I'm happy to see that DBC has taken the time to incorporate some of this into its curriculum. We learned in the beginning a bit on mindfulness and empathy and it reminded me of a book in college I read by Thich Nhat Hanh called The Miracle of Mindfulness. It was a very short easy to read book, but the concepts it talked about especially in regard to the basic benefits of being mindful in life really had a lasting effect on me. It became very clear to me that the more mindful you can be in any situation, especially in regard to your own subconscious fears or hangups, ways in which you may sabotage yourself, or the more empathy you can have for those things in others, the better the outcome of that situation will be. Both for yourself and everyone involved. There's probably lots of other examples I could talk about regarding stereotypes in our society in general, but having heard stories of experiences from my friends and having had my own small brushes with them in my own life, I look forward to seeing what else DBC has to offer us in this regard, and continuing my experience at living mindfully for the rest of my time on this planet.</p>

		<h3 class="art_title">Pair Programming</h3>
		<img src="images/pair_programming.jpg">
		<div>
			<h4>Dev Bootcamp</h4>
			<p>We do a lot of pair programming at DBC, even during Phase 0. Because we're still scattered and working from our homes at this point it's done remotely via video chat, which is not as easy as it is in person, but it is something I've come to look forward to especially on some of the harder challenges.</p>

			<h4>Shared Problem-solving</h4>
			<p>The biggest benefit of pairing with someone for me is being able to put our heads together when solving a challenge. I find almost always this results in a better end product then I would have achieved on my own. Even when I'm able to solve most of the challenge myself, I still find myself benefiting and learning from the ideas of the person I'm working with.</p>
			<p>It's true that people have different learning styles and different approaches to problem solving in general, which can be the one possible hang-up when working together. But so far I've found that most people at DBC are very easy to work with, and the culture in general promotes an environment of everyone being in the same boat together, with constant communication and feedback between all of us involved.</p>
		</div>

		<img src="images/muppetspairprogramming.jpg" width="450px">

		<div>
			<h4>Feedback</h4>
			<p>There is a lot of feedback at DBC and the owner designed it that way. The idea makes sense, especially in an educational setting, and good feedback really is more useful then letter grades.</p>
			<p>The feedback I've received so far has been reassuring. I haven't had any bad pairing sessions, and everyone has been pretty easy overall to work with. The one thing I, and everyone really, has that we can always work on is learning and taking into consideration everyone's different approaches and learning styles. That and in some cases our different levels of experience. I know I often like to experiment and try out code just to learn what happens, which isn't everyone's approach. I do my best to always explain what I'm thinking and why I want to try something, and when others have their own ideas I expect the same. That relationship seems to work well, even when we separate briefly if it's in approach or in needing more time for review, having that communication between each other is really all I think is needed to bridge that gap. And all of it is good experience working with others, which is never a bad thing to have.</p>

		<h3 class="art_title">The Cost of Free</h3>
		<img src="images/1984mac.jpg" height="453px" width="600px">
		<div>
			<h4>Big Brother is <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Watching</span> Selling</h4>
			<p>One of the biggest changes to our social contract that the internet has brought for better or worse is the concept of free. Not that it was a new concept, no sale has ever been complete without the idea of getting something for nothing, but the notion that a product or service could be provided free of charge indefinitely not because of a sale but as its normal state of being I believe was new to the internet age. The concept of making money without charging money had as far as I can tell only existed in one other place prior to the internet's conception.</p>

			<h4>The Idiot Box</h4>
			<p>In the early days of television there was a financial limitation to be overcome. The silver screen, the original screen, had monetization built in. It was housed in a theater, a place outside the home, and guarded by a box office ticket attendant. To see a movie for free meant sneaking into the theater, doing something illegal and forbidden. The cinema inherited it's monetary existence from live theater. But television from the start was different. You couldn't charge someone to turn on their television. Once the cost of the hardware was paid for, there was no way of charging for the content on the screen. Thus a model inherited from print was translated to the stage within the home.</p>

			<h4>Feel Me from the Inside</h4>
			<p>The early days of television advertising were not exceptionally different from the early days of banner ads and pop-up windows on the web. Preconceived sales pitches were hurled at the unsuspecting consumer. As wide a net as possible was cast, hoping to catch more fish by sheer volume. The consumer of the advertisement remained as blank a face as the ad man behind it. But as time would lend further sophistication to television advertising, nothing it was capable of could prepare it for the possibilities opened by the internet. In television, the two-faced screen of 1984 was never able to leave the marketing focus group. With the world wide web however, the focus became the entire world as soon as they logged in.</p>
		</div>

		<img src="images/apple1984.jpg" height="432px" width="600px">

		<div>
			<h4>Brave New World</h4>
			<p>The rise of fundamentally advertising corporations parading as technology companies has only continued to grow since the advent of web 2.0. For the first time in history companies exist whose mission statement is not only to control the world's information, but whose capabilities actually are equivalent to surmounting that task. They bring in money hand-over-fist without charging a penny for their services. They present on the surface a world of unlimited access for all, with the only caveat being a slight of hand for all you hear and see.</p>
			
			<h4>A Dent in the Universe</h4>
			<p>A favorite quote of mine by Steve Jobs is about how everything you see in the world, at least everything man-made, was put there by another person no smarter then you. That it's all been created, every little thing, to benefit someone, and whether you're included in that is just a matter of design. If our world is really composed of such things, and I believe it is, then designing our future is really up to us, in our hands. I don't want to see it created obliviously or allow those with selfish motives to make it less then it could be.</p>
			<p>I started talking about the idea of free, and the unseen cost of it in our digital age. The idea of a future world where all we know and are is a mechanism to sell us something for another's gain. Because that isn't my idea of a future I would like to be a part of, and because I am a part of determining that future, I would like to play a role in the re-imagining of the internet. The world wide web really is the greatest form of communication we've developed as a species, and to turn it over to those with a vision of the future other then my own seems oppositional to my reason for being.</p>
			<p>Can we develop a better way to monetize the web for as long as we need money, besides the vision of a world in which a two-faced screen through which we get all our information can never be trusted? I believe we can, and I'm willing to work towards that goal.</p>
			<h4>"We're here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?"</h4>

		<h3 class="art_title">My thinking and learning style</h3>
		<img src="images/conran.png">
		<div>
			<p>As a kinesthetic learner with a concrete random thinking style I think DBC's hands-on approach is the right choice for me.</p>
			<p>I learn best by doing and I retain information better by trying out what I've learned and putting it to the test. Being able to experiment either by trial and error or by tinkering with the parts of something to see what they do is what I need to grow.</p>
			<p>I'm glad DBC had us research our thinking and learning styles right off the bat. Although I knew most of this intuitively, being able to think about it has helped me to better make the provided resources work for me. One example of this is the various tutorial sites I've begun using since starting Phase 0. Although they generally take a long time to complete, I've found I'm learning more from them then most of the other resources that have been provided. <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> is an especially a good site which I've spent many hours on completing their lessons.</p> 
			<p>One of the biggest downsides to this however is the time commitment and the tendency to get lost down rabbit holes, both of which have been my largest struggles so far. I'm sure everyone at DBC is a very eager learner or we wouldn't be here, but finding a balance of how I utilize my time and how much I spend delving into any particular topic is the challenge I'm currently facing. As much as I want to learn everything about everything, timeboxing is definitely crucial to staying on track with the quick pace of material and techniques like Pomodoro I'm hoping will be useful for me in this area. I've also found it helpful each week to review the challenges beforehand and get a sense of what needs to be accomplished so I can assess how to best allocate my time.</p>
			<p>In terms of broadening and growing my thinking and learning styles, I think the variety of resources both provided by DBC and out on the web in general are a great way of doing this. To stick to only one way of learning would surely make it more difficult even just trying to find resources that only cater to that one style. Information is everywhere and in a whole variety of forms, but often times the quickest and easiest to access is the best. I can't rely on lengthy tutorials to answer all of my questions so sometimes reading an article or watching a video is the right choice for me.</p>
			<p>The more we continue learning in general the more I believe our learning styles will naturally broaden and strengthen at the same time. I think a final challenge in all of this will be retention. Not just learning new material as fast as you can, but also finding ways to maintain that knowledge once you've moved on to the next topic. That's what I'm currently wrestling with as we enter the next stage in Phase 0.</p>

		<h3 class="art_title">DBC Culture</h3>
		<img src="images/Dev-Bootcamp.png">
		<div>
			<p>Shereef's metaphor of the restaurant and the kitchen resonated with me, and I think it's an astute one. I've had the same realization myself in my past educational experiences, and I think it's true of most things in life that you get out what you put in.</p>
			<p>As a concrete random thinker and a kinesthetic learner it seems like I'm in the right place. Learning by doing and taking charge of your own experience both go well with how I operate.</p>
			<p>I'm glad DBC has its own intentional culture. I think that's definitely important if you want everyone involved to be successful and I'm glad it's so well thought through. The social and community aspect of learning is really why I'm here and why I'm not trying to teach myself everything on my own.</p>
			<p>I'm both nervous and excited for Phase 1 to begin, which I'm sure is normal and expected. I am coming from a background of zero coding experience so I know I have a lot to learn, but at least I'm confident I'm in the right place :)</p>
