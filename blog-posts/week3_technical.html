			<h3>Javascript</h3>

				<h4>History</h4>
				<p>I'm totally new to Javascript, so I did some research to figure out what it's all about.</p>
				<p>Javascript began at Netscape in the early 1990's as a way to add interactivity to web pages. Since then it's grown to become a prevalent force on the internet.</p>

				<h4>It's fast</h4>
				<p>One reason for Javascript's success is its ability to add dynamic content and interactivity to a website without requiring access to a server. Before Javascript the kind of functionality that it delivers required constant communication back and forth between the browser and server. Javascript allows for much of this work to be handled considerably faster without the need to wait for sending and receiving messages.</p>
				<p>Javascript also allows you to add your code to a page and without having to compile or load a virtual machine you can see your changes right away. This greatly speeds up the process of testing code for developers and makes development and updates much easier.</p>

				<h4>It's powerful</h4>
				<p>Another reason Javascript has become so popular is because it's an object-oriented language. Having been based on Java and (to a lesser extent) C++, this makes Javascript an ideal way to interact with objects on your website. The way it interacts with the DOM and HTML also gives it the ability to manipulate web pages on a deep level.</p>
				
				<h4>It's supported</h4>
				<p>Because Javascript has been around for awhile and steadily grown in its use, most if not all modern browsers have great support for it, meaning you can expect the same functionality across all your users' experiences. This element is crucial to Javascript's success, and the more that it grows in use the more support will continue to stick around. </p>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>Of course not everything about Javascript is well-received.</p>
				<p>The main issues with the language from what I uncovered seem to be about security. Of course anytime you have a powerful tool at your disposal and users can interact with that tool that leaves open the possibilty of malicious input invading your code. For this reason many browsers also come with an ability to disable Javascript, and users may choose to do so for their own security. This runs into one of the biggest keys to Javascript's success, its ubiquity of support. Although it may not be likely to derail Javascript's growth anytime soon, it does remain an achilles heal that could one day be exploited by a newer more secure language with equal abilities.</p>
				<h4>Happy Scripting!</h4>
