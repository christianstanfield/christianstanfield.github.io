				<h4>Exploring my Values</h4>
				<p>I chose self-knowledge from the list of values as the most important for me because as I was going down the list and seeing the values that resonated with me, what ultimately tied them all together and has genuinely led to the times in my life when I've been the most happy/satisfied has been knowing myself enough to make the right decisions, to pursue the things that would make me happy and hold on to the things that mattered. When I saw self-knowledge on the list, it reminded me of the old maxim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself" target="_blank">know thyself</a>, which has always resonated with me and helped me find my way in life when I was lost.</p>
				<p>It's definitely one of the more cheesy things anyone can say, and as such I think it has lost a lot of its meaning, but the phrase follow your heart I think is similar in a lot of ways. Whatever makes you most happy or feel most fulfilled in life, to know what those things are in the first place and secondly to know how to follow them begins as I see it with knowing yourself. It's a lifelong process of discovery, or at least it has been for me, but with each step I feel like I get closer not just to being in harmony with myself, but also with the world around me at the same time, as the two come together in a sense hand in hand.</p>

				<h4>This above All: To Thine Own Self be True</h4>
				<p>I think life in general is always up and down. We make mistakes but we learn from them, and we grow as such. As someone who's suffered from depression, growing up I never really expected to live very long, which it turns out is a symptom of depression. But I can actually say that in a very real sense my life has gotten better over time, and the one tangible thing I can see that has changed with time is my knowledge of myself. It comes back in a way to mindfulness and some of the material we talked about earlier when we started Phase 0.</p>
				<p>Finding your place in the world isn't easy and never will be I'm sure. But it's a journey we're all on together and one that our experiences at DBC are a part of. Something in our lives has led us all here to wanting to become developers. Knowing what that is I think is as important as knowing how to get there. I look forward to exploring both more in depth as we go, and continuing the life journey that brought me here, and wherever I'll end up next.</p>
