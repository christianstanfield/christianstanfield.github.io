				<h4>Dev Bootcamp</h4>
				<p>We do a lot of pair programming at DBC, even during Phase 0. Because we're still scattered and working from our homes at this point it's done remotely via video chat, which is not as easy as it is in person, but it is something I've come to look forward to especially on some of the harder challenges.</p>

				<h4>Shared Problem-solving</h4>
				<p>The biggest benefit of pairing with someone for me is being able to put our heads together when solving a challenge. I find almost always this results in a better end product then I would have achieved on my own. Even when I'm able to solve most of the challenge myself, I still find myself benefiting and learning from the ideas of the person I'm working with.</p>
				<p>It's true that people have different learning styles and different approaches to problem solving in general, which can be the one possible hang-up when working together. But so far I've found that most people at DBC are very easy to work with, and the culture in general promotes an environment of everyone being in the same boat together, with constant communication and feedback between all of us involved.</p>

				<h4>Feedback</h4>
				<p>There is a lot of feedback at DBC and the owner designed it that way. The idea makes sense, especially in an educational setting, and good feedback really is more useful then letter grades.</p>
				<p>The feedback I've received so far has been reassuring. I haven't had any bad pairing sessions, and everyone has been pretty easy overall to work with. The one thing I, and everyone really, has that we can always work on is learning and taking into consideration everyone's different approaches and learning styles. That and in some cases our different levels of experience. I know I often like to experiment and try out code just to learn what happens, which isn't everyone's approach. I do my best to always explain what I'm thinking and why I want to try something, and when others have their own ideas I expect the same. That relationship seems to work well, even when we separate briefly if it's in approach or in needing more time for review, having that communication between each other is really all I think is needed to bridge that gap. And all of it is good experience working with others, which is never a bad thing to have.</p>
