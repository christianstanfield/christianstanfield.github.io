				<h4>Big Brother is <span id="strike">Watching</span> Selling</h4>
				<p>One of the biggest changes to our social contract that the internet has brought for better or worse is the concept of free. Not that it was a new concept, no sale has ever been complete without the idea of getting something for nothing, but the notion that a product or service could be provided free of charge indefinitely not because of a sale but as its normal state of being I believe was new to the internet age. The concept of making money without charging money had as far as I can tell only existed in one other place prior to the internet's conception.</p>

				<h4>The Idiot Box</h4>
				<p>In the early days of television there was a financial limitation to be overcome. The silver screen, the original screen, had monetization built in. It was housed in a theater, a place outside the home, and guarded by a box office ticket attendant. To see a movie for free meant sneaking into the theater, doing something illegal and forbidden. The cinema inherited it's monetary existence from live theater. But television from the start was different. You couldn't charge someone to turn on their television. Once the cost of the hardware was paid for, there was no way of charging for the content on the screen. Thus a model inherited from print was translated to the stage within the home.</p>

				<h4>Feel Me from the Inside</h4>
				<p>The early days of television advertising were not exceptionally different from the early days of banner ads and pop-up windows on the web. Preconceived sales pitches were hurled at the unsuspecting consumer. As wide a net as possible was cast, hoping to catch more fish by sheer volume. The consumer of the advertisement remained as blank a face as the ad man behind it. But as time would lend further sophistication to television advertising, nothing it was capable of could prepare it for the possibilities opened by the internet. In television, the two-faced screen of 1984 was never able to leave the marketing focus group. With the world wide web however, the focus became the entire world as soon as they logged in.</p>

				<h4>Brave New World</h4>
				<p>The rise of fundamentally advertising corporations parading as technology companies has only continued to grow since the advent of web 2.0. For the first time in history companies exist whose mission statement is not only to control the world's information, but whose capabilities actually are equivalent to surmounting that task. They bring in money hand-over-fist without charging a penny for their services. They present on the surface a world of unlimited access for all, with the only caveat being a slight of hand for all you hear and see.</p>
				
				<h4>A Dent in the Universe</h4>
				<p>A favorite quote of mine by Steve Jobs is about how everything you see in the world, at least everything man-made, was put there by another person no smarter then you. That it's all been created, every little thing, to benefit someone, and whether you're included in that is just a matter of design. If our world is really composed of such things, and I believe it is, then designing our future is really up to us, in our hands. I don't want to see it created obliviously or allow those with selfish motives to make it less then it could be.</p>
				<p>I started talking about the idea of free, and the unseen cost of it in our digital age. The idea of a future world where all we know and are is a mechanism to sell us something for another's gain. Because that isn't my idea of a future I would like to be a part of, and because I am a part of determining that future, I would like to play a role in the re-imagining of the internet. The world wide web really is the greatest form of communication we've developed as a species, and to turn it over to those with a vision of the future other then my own seems oppositional to my reason for being.</p>
				<p>Can we develop a better way to monetize the web for as long as we need money, besides the vision of a world in which a two-faced screen through which we get all our information can never be trusted? I believe we can, and I'm willing to work towards that goal.</p>
