				<h4>My Experience</h4>
				<p>Dealing with the negative consequences of stereotypes and stereotype threat has not been a big part of my life for me personally. As a white male, the closest I've come to ever experiencing any racism or prejudice directly, besides hearing stories from non-white friends, has been a handful of mostly indirect experiences.</p>

				<h4>Worker Clones</h4>
				<p>The biggest example I can think of is from my last job. I was one of several different department directors who were in charge of hiring for the company and although I didn't realize it at first, there was a distinct difference in my approach, and therefore my department, when it came to my hiring style.</p>
				<p>Where I worked there was not a shortage of women, in fact the company was probably over 50% women although it was started and owned by three men. It was in the wedding industry, so maybe that's a stereotype in and off itself that the company was mostly women, but that is just how it always was when I was there. Racially though it was pretty white. There were less then a handful of non-white employees when I started, and for the most part outside of my department that number didn't really change.</p>
				<p>I'm not sure when I first realized it, it was after a while of being there, but it distinctly occured to me one day how different my hiring style was then the other directors. Each of them seemed to be following the same pattern within their respective departments, hiring only new employees who as closely as possible resembled themselves. Not just physically, but personality-wise, in every way possible. They all seemed to have created little pods of clones of themselves, people who listened to the same music, talked about the same things, etc. It must have been like looking in the mirror for them all day. I apparently never got this memo.</p>
				<p>Personally the whole idea of being surrounded by people just like me all day seems totally depressing. Why anyone would want that I do not understand. My hiring style was only ever interviewing the top candidates and choosing the best for the job to join our team. That didn't bring in all minorities naturally, but it certainly brought in a mix basically equivalent to the diversity that applied. Which pretty quickly began to stand out.</p>
				<p>The company even produced a video of itself and in showing off its employees came specifically to my department to film several of my people for the explicit purpose of making them look more diverse. They wanted to the outside world to appear like they weren't all the same, but at the same time they all wanted to be the same.</p>

				<h4>Self-Handicapping</h4>
				<p>Although I haven't personally encountered a lot of stereotype threat, the concept of subconscious self-handicapping is one I feel I've seen too often in others and at times in myself.</p>
				<p>Like everyone I've definitely developed my own fears, both conscious and subconsious, throughout the course of my life. I would say it's almost impossible not to without living in a pretty intense bubble separated from the real world. Talking about our fears, and making them conscious whether through self-reflection or however you find a way, is the first step I think to recovery from the negative effects they can have on us. I'm happy to see that DBC has taken the time to incorporate some of this into its curriculum. We learned in the beginning a bit on mindfulness and empathy and it reminded me of a book in college I read by Thich Nhat Hanh called The Miracle of Mindfulness. It was a very short easy to read book, but the concepts it talked about especially in regard to the basic benefits of being mindful in life really had a lasting effect on me. It became very clear to me that the more mindful you can be in any situation, especially in regard to your own subconscious fears or hangups, ways in which you may sabotage yourself, or the more empathy you can have for those things in others, the better the outcome of that situation will be. Both for yourself and everyone involved. There's probably lots of other examples I could talk about regarding stereotypes in our society in general, but having heard stories of experiences from my friends and having had my own small brushes with them in my own life, I look forward to seeing what else DBC has to offer us in this regard, and continuing my experience at living mindfully for the rest of my time on this planet.</p>
