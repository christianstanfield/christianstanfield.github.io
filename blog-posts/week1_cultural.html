			<h3>dbc | culture</h3>
			<p>I think Shereef's metaphor of the restaurant and the kitchen is an astute one. I've had the same realization myself in my past educational experiences, and I think it's true of most things in life that you get out what you put in.</p>
			<p>As a concrete random thinker and a kinesthetic learner it seems like I'm in the right place (thankfully!). Learning by doing and taking charge of your own experience both go well with how I operate.</p>
			<p>I'm glad DBC has its own intentional culture. I think that's definitely important if you want everyone involved to be successful and I'm glad it's so well thought out. The social and community aspect of learning is really why I'm here and why I'm not trying to teach myself everything on my own.</p>
			<p>I'm both nervous and excited for Phase 1 to begin, which I'm sure is normal. I am coming from a background of zero coding experience so I know I have a lot to learn, but at least I'm confident I'm in the right place :)</p>
