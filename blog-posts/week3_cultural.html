			<h3>My thinking and learning style</h3>

				<p>As a kinesthetic learner with a concrete random thinking style I think DBC's hands-on approach is the right choice for me.</p>
				<p>I learn best by doing and I retain information better by trying out what I've learned and putting it to the test. Being able to experiment either by trial and error or by tinkering with the parts of something to see what they do is what I need to grow.</p>
				<p>I'm glad DBC had us research our thinking and learning styles right off the bat. Although I knew most of this intuitively, being able to think about it has helped me to better make the provided resources work for me. One example of this is the various tutorial sites I've begun using since starting Phase 0. Although they generally take a long time to complete, I've found I'm learning more from them then most of the other resources that have been provided. <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Code Academy</a> is an especially a good site which I've spent many hours on completing their lessons.</p> 
				<p>One of the biggest downsides to this however is the time commitment and the tendency to get lost down rabbit holes, both of which have been my largest struggles so far. I'm sure everyone at DBC is a very eager learner or we wouldn't be here, but finding a balance of how I utilize my time and how much I spend delving into any particular topic is the challenge I'm currently facing. As much as I want to learn everything about everything, timeboxing is definitely crucial to staying on track with the quick pace of material and techniques like Pomodoro I'm hoping will be useful for me in this area. I've also found it helpful each week to review the challenges beforehand and get a sense of what needs to be accomplished so I can assess how to best allocate my time.</p>
				<p>In terms of broadening and growing my thinking and learning styles, I think the variety of resources both provided by DBC and out on the web in general are a great way of doing this. To stick to only one way of learning would surely make it more difficult even just trying to find resources that only cater to that one style. Information is everywhere and in a whole variety of forms, but often times the quickest and easiest to access is the best. I can't rely on lengthy tutorials to answer all of my questions so sometimes reading an article or watching a video is the right choice for me.</p>
				<p>The more we continue learning in general the more I believe our learning styles will naturally broaden and strengthen at the same time. I think a final challenge in all of this will be retention. Not just learning new material as fast as you can, but also finding ways to maintain that knowledge once you've moved on to the next topic. That's what I'm currently wrestling with as we enter the next stage in Phase 0.</p>
