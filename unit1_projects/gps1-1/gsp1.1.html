      <h1>Guided Pair Sessions with DBC</h1>
    	<h4>What do you think about pair-programming?</h4>
     	<ul>
      	<li>Christian: Pair-programming is a good way to learn alongside someone else and put your minds together to learn from one another. </li>
        <li>Sean: Pair-programming is an interesting tool for teaching and learning code, but also for collaborating wirelessly. It brings people together who have never met and could be geographically far apart.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Why is Pair-Programming is important to DBC?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pair-Programming is fairly common in the industry according to the founder</li>
        <li>In an educational setting it helps you learn from one another</li>
        <li>It teaches you interpersonal skills in addition to technical skills</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Define Driver & Navigator</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Driver: The person whose hands are on the keyboard and does the actual typing.</li>
        <li>Navigator: The person who guides the driver and communicates what the code is trying to accomplish.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Reflections</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Christian: I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but once we started it became pretty natural and being able to bounce ideas off each other throughout the challenge was definitely helpful.</li>
        <li>Sean: I was a little nervouse but settled into it once the challenge got going. There were some early issues with Stypi not working, but in the end using collabedit was good because Christian and I had to communicate what each of us were seeing independently in Sublime since we could not preview the site.</li>
