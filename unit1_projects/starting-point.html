        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>Responsive design is the process of designing websites for different screen sizes/devices. CSS Media Queries are used to reposition and adjust elements based on the size of the device's screen. Following responsive design allows the developer to avoid creating separate versions for mobile and desktop.<sup><a href="#treehouse">1</a></sup></p>

        <h3>Fluid Layouts</h3>
        <p>In fixed layout scenario, the width of the page and various elements are defined by a specific number of pixels. In contrast, a fluid website design is defined by percentages based on the user's screen resolution.<sup><a href="#smashing">2</a></sup></p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Responsive design has many benefits for both developers and end users. For the developer it may be extra work on the front end but it optimizes your site for a whole variety of screen sizes and devices without having to build separate mobile versions. It also future-proofs your site for new device sizes that may not be known at the present time. For the end user the benefit is having the most tailored experience for their device regardless of screen size.<sup><a href="#marcotte">3</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing these concepts was a little challenging at first, but as things came together, we were very excited to see the results actually display as desired. It was a good experience to try different techniques and see how they changed the site layout.</li>
        <li>Tablets and smartphones created a variety screen sizes that developers must account for if they want to deliver good experiences. In the future, as additional devices come to market, developers will need to make sure their sites look good for all screen sizes.</li> 
        <li>Visually impaired people have to use the web in a slightly different fashion; they make use of alt tag descriptions on images so that they can understand what a site's visual aspects are. They also have screen readers like VoiceOver, and make use of various dictation software. Following basic web development guidelines for the accesiblity are easy enough and should be encouraged.</li> 
        <li>One idea that has resonated with us, is that there are numerous ways to both design web pages and implement code. Different designers have different philosophies and no particular philosophy is right or wrong, so it comes down to the individual designer's preference. It's also interesting to see how design techniques have changed over time in reaction to changes in technology (i.e. mobile-specific websites versus responsive design). Things we're doing today that make sense for our time may change in the future, and during that transition, the things we do today may no longer make sense...at least temporarily.</li>
