			<p>Soundcloud is all about content. The design needs to bring that to the front and otherwise stay out of your way, which is mostly accomplishes. Where I think it needs work is in the organization.</p>
			<p>From the main page you can access your stream in a scrolling feed which takes over most of the real estate, but is only one of the ways of accessing your content. An image with text explaining reposting takes up a central place on the main page and offers very little even for first time users. Suggestions of who to follow and a few of your most recent likes are available, but everything else is buried within a menu in a menu on the top.</p>
			<p>If I could change anything I would offer more customization in what is displayed in each section and I would have each feature of the site more easily accessible. Since the different ways of organizing your content overlap so much I would also blend exploration closer together between them. Visually the design does a decent job of putting the content forward, but it needs to also get out of the way when you're interacting with it.</p>
